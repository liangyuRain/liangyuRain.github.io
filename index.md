## About Me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by [Prof. Arvind Krishnamurthy](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind). I also completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Washington, earning a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Applied & Computational Mathematical Sciences (Discrete Math and Algorithms).

My CV can be found [here](https://liangyurain.github.io/assets/files/CV/main.pdf).

## Research Interests

Machine learning systems, distributed systems, collective communications; broadly speaking, I am interested in formulating and solving mathematical problems in computer systems and networking.
